    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Prep Time: 30 mins | Cook Time: 4 hrs | Additional Time: 12 hrs 30 mins</p>
    <p>Total Time: 17 hrs | Servings: 24 | Yield: 1 (18lb) turkey</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (18 pound) whole turkey, neck and giblets removed</li>
        <li>2 cups kosher salt</li>
        <li>Â½ cup butter, melted, divided</li>
        <li>2 large onions, chopped, divided</li>
        <li>4 carrots, coarsely chopped, divided</li>
        <li>4 stalks celery, chopped, divided</li>
        <li>2 sprigs fresh thyme, divided</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>1 cup dry white wine</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Rub turkey inside and out with kosher salt; place in a large stockpot and cover with cold water. Cover and refrigerate to allow turkey to soak in brine solution for 12 hours, or overnight.</li>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Thoroughly rinse the turkey; discard the brine mixture.</li>
        <li>Brush turkey with 1/2 of the melted butter. Place breast-side down on a roasting rack in a shallow roasting pan. Stuff turkey cavity with 1/2 the onion, 1/2 the carrots, 1/2 the celery, 1 sprig of thyme, and bay leaf. Scatter remaining vegetables and thyme in the bottom of the roasting pan; pour white wine over vegetables.</li>
        <li>Roast turkey in the preheated oven, uncovered, until no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 3 1/2 to 4 hours. Carefully turn turkey breast-side up about 2/3 through the roasting time, and brush with remaining butter. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the thigh, near the bone, should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Allow turkey to rest for 30 minutes before carving.</li>
    </ol>
